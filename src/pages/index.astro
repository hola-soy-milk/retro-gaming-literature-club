      <p>
        We are a group of people who love retro games and want to share our love
        with others. We meet every 2 weeks to discuss a game we all played and
        share our thoughts on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a Discord server where we talk about games, share
        recommendations, and help each other out with any issues we might have
        with our games.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in joining us, click the button above to join our
        Discord server. We would love to have you!
