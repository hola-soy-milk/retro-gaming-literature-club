      <p>
        We are a group of people who love retro games and want to share our love
        with others. We meet every 2 weeks to discuss a game we all played and
        share our thoughts on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meet on Discord where we talk about games, share recommendations, and
        help each other out with any issues we might have with our games.
      </p>
